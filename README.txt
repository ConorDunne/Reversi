The project workload was divided by function work

We used the files provided by Liliana Pasquel for the initialization of the game and printing of the board.
These are the files in the board.c file.

We split the work evenly between us. Each of us got certain functions to build.
Caoimhe focues on the game logic and created the functions,
	validMove
	endsWithYourColour
	findValidMove
and a lot of debugging

Conor focues on the playing of the game and created the fuctions,
	movePlayer
	flipCounter
	scanCounter
	returnAndFlip

We knew the problem could be broken down into parts.
	Before Move is made
	After Move is made

Before the move was made, we had to check for square that would allow a valid move
and alert the player to this move. We had done this before we knew of the 
beast called linked lists. By the time we learnt of them in class, we had already
completed this part of the assignment and it would be too much work to start
over with our project again.

After the move was made, we had to place the counter down and flip all captured
disks and counters before calculating the points.

Thanks for reading this file as instructed.

This message comes from Conor and Caoimhe.
Together they created a dream team and an abomination upon humanity.
Try to reversi that.
